It was fun to actually start doing some CAD and messing around with all of the different tools and features!

I am starting to figure out more of the Onshape tools, whereas before I was mostly just following the tutorial. It's nice to feel like I can actually do stuff, and to actually understand what I am doing.

I am having a lot of fun with Onshape! It is cool to start making more advanced things, though I am a bit intimidated by the wheel.
