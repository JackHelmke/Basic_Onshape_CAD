I am starting to figure out more of the Onshape tools, whereas before I was mostly just following the tutorial. It's nice to feel like I can actually do stuff, and to actually understand what I am doing.

I am having a lot of fun with Onshape! It is cool to start making more advanced things, though I am a bit intimidated by the wheel.

I was a little bit scared of this one, but it didn't end up being that bad. I'm excited to start actually putting this thing together!
